# 3-Tier-Archi
# This document shows the working process of a 3-tier application.

This project implements a 3-tier architecture that separates the application into three distinct layers:

1. Presentation Layer: The user interface, which interacts with the user and displays data.
2. Application Layer: The business logic, which processes data and performs operations based on user input.
3. Data Layer: The data storage, which handles data management and retrieval.

This separation of concerns improves scalability, maintainability, and manageability of the application.
